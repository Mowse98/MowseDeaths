# MowseDeaths

A simple datapack I made to add some quality of life and customisation to the vanilla system, while keeping the vanilla feel.

You can freely use this datapack in your maps and edit it with or without attribution.

## Default functionality

* Your entire inventory drops on death
* There is an attempt to protect your items from initial danger (e.g. falling into the void/lava)
* Items are organised so you pick them up somewhat as you dropped them. Hotbar > Inventory > Armour > Offhand. It does not automatically equip your armour and offhand
* Your death pile glows and emits particles
* Your death piles is not invlunerable and despawns after 20 minutes

## Settings

There is a function called 'settings' where you can edit the behaviour of this datapack. This gets run when you reload.

* You can remove glowing/particles
* You can make items invulnerable (though there is a 1 tick delay where a really fast chain of explosions could destroy a death pile. I don't recommend turning on Invulnerable items for this reason)
* You can change items to despawn after the vanilla 5 minutes or never
* You can stop the hazard check so items simply group up and land where you died

## Intstalling

* Click the green '<> Code' button at the top and Download as Zip
* Put this folder in your datapacks folder
